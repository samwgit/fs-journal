## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
- console.log(), console.error('error.message') One for checking various components the other for error code reporting
2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
- Inspect Element/Dev Kit this is incredibly useful as testing within a controlled space is much better then coding, saving, then refreshing every 5 seconds
3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
- As previously stated try to do it within a controlled space like a code playground or even your devtools
