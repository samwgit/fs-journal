## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
- unit testing, component testing, and end to end testing. each of these are independently useful due to their specificity.
2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
- I think that component testing is the most useful because its just enough specificity to really analyze an entire section but not too much or too little so your not overanalyzing or missing the obvious. 
3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
- I think unit testing is least useful due to the scope of the actual testing, the issue typically lies within minor mistakes which requires more specificity you cannot get these results if you are testing a unit.
