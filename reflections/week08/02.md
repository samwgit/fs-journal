## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?
- communication is really important when it comes to coordinating new implementations, fixes, modifications, etc.
2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
- 3 options done quickly, low cost, or high quality I think the trade offs are pretty obvious just going off the names of the sides.
