# Daily Reflection
Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? How are you working? Client -> Server, focusing only on the server for now?  

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Today went wonderful, backend is complete and frontend visuals are about 60% done.
- Are you managing your stress?
- I am trying my best but inside I am panicking
- What has you most worried?
- Missing a very small mistake and causing me to fail.
