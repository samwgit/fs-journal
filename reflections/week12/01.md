# Daily Reflection
This is a stressful week! You are working on a project that closely mimics what you will be expected to accomplish during a standard 40 hour work week. Are you enjoying the struggles? Are you managing your time wisely? 

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- It's going okay I have 60% of my backend complete.
- Are you managing your stress?
- I'm managing.
- What has you most worried?
- Being rusty on the frontend after practicing the backend for so long.
