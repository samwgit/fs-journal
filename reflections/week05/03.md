## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?
- Assigning fixed amounts of time to various tasks 
2. What three strategies will you implement and how?
- Instead of working for 12 hours straight I will allot specified times for working and specified cool down times instead of crunching everything within 12 hours (like I did with most of my checkpoints)
3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 
- With my 3rd and 4th checkpoint I honestly entered a stage of panic thinking I wouldn't be able to complete the two in time for the deadline of the checkpoint and because of that stress I ended up making really simple mistakes and overthinking literally 3 lines of code that made me fail my week 3 checkpoint, in retrospect I should've just analyzed the code from line 1 to the end and that would've had me find the solution withing a very short amount of time.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
- As mentioned in the prior journal I am going to request tutoring to go over a couple of things this week that have not really clicked for me, with the hackathon however and me being sick as well I was not able to get the timing right to go over those concepts.
