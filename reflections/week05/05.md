# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- Honestly i'd say this week has been the worst for me, I feel very lost due to being ill for two of the days and really feel like i'm behind unfortunately.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What shocked me the most was probably just how much simpler the code is starting to look and function with these added modules and server end solutions, however it makes it much more complicated when trying to accomplish simple feats.
- What are you struggling with?
- Most of this weeks concepts really felt like a blur due to not being physically present for most of the core teaching sessions.
- What would you count as a victory?
- Being able to recovery quickly from my illness and working with my hackathon team the day I get back to really plan and illustrate our fourm.
