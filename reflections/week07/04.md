## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
- Strong user experience was a great read, will be attempting to try using some of the things talked about in said reading
2. What went well this week?
- Honestly, the front end went okay this week, however having to do backend after working on primarily the front end was a big switch I def needed more time for.
3. What would you do differently?
- Honestly, asking more questions is probably one of the biggest things i'd want to work on.
