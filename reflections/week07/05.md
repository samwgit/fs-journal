# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- The front end went decently well.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What shocked me this week was having to do the entire backend of this project in such a short span of time.
- What are you struggling with?
- The material i'm learning is coming so fast and passing and then I have to move onto the next thing after the fact, its incredibly hard for me to retain most
- of the information given to me because i'm being fed information through a firehose.
- What would you count as a victory?
- I would count just being able to not stress about failing the course since I passed the previous checkpoint I can take my time and learn with this project instead of  rushing it to reach the deadline
